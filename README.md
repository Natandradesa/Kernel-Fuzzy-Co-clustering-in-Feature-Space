In this repository, there are the  implementations of the  co-clustering algorithms of the paper: "[Kernel-based Fuzzy Co-clustering in Feature Space with Automated Variable Weighting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9882838)".  

In the file named co_clustering_algorithms.py there are the codes of the co-clustering methods. In the file 
data_generation.py there are the code for generate the data block as was made in the paper.

In the folder called datasets there are only two datasets: cstr and yale, both used in the article. The other datasets can be easily found in the UCI. In both dataset, the last column is related to the class of the objects.
